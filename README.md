Play a 'story' based version of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Machine Gun against the computer. 

This (or its first iteration, anyway) was the first programming project I ever came up with and completed on my own. It came to be when I first started programming in ~2013 (I think). I had just written a very simple console based Rock Paper Scissors program in JavaScript as part of a Codecademy tutorial and I wanted to make something bigger out of it. So I did.

It is neither very complicated nor very interesting, but it was a place to start.
